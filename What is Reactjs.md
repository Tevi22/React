## What is React JS? ##

1. React JS is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces
2. ReactJS Optimizes the DOM manipulation by writing very simple code
3. React is used for applications where the data keeps changing very frequently

**Features​​​​​​​**

1. Component based architecture
    -a-nything that you want to render on the browser can be rendered through components
2. Virtual DOM
    - React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application
3.Unidirectional data flow
    -React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy for debugging.
4. JSX 
-React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax which makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components
5. SEO performance
    - The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept. We can develop isomorphic applications using React which increases the SEO performance.

## Installing React ##

To start working with React in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you'll first need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer if you haven't already. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can follow these steps to set up a React project in VSCode:

1. Open a Terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt. You can use the integrated terminal within VSCode as well.

2. Create a React App:
Run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App. Replace "my-react-app" with the desired name of your project.

***npx create-react-app my-react-app***

This command will create a new directory called my-react-app with the basic structure of a React project.

3. Change Directory:
Navigate to your newly created React app folder using the following command:

***cd my-react-app***

4. Open in VSCode:
Open the project in Visual Studio Code using the command:

***code .***

This assumes that you have added VSCode to your system PATH during installation. If not, you may need to open VSCode and use the "Open Folder" option.

5. Start the Development Server:
Inside VSCode's integrated terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

***npm start***

This will start the development server, and you should be able to see your React app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Now, you have set up a basic React app in VSCode. You can start editing your React components and see the changes live as you save your files.

Remember that these steps assume you have Node.js, npm, and VSCode installed. If you encounter any issues during the installation or setup process, make sure to check the official documentation for each tool for troubleshooting.
